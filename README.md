## What is this?
Irc4netButSmarter is a modernized, .NET Core compatible, fork of SmartIrc4net
which is a C# class for communication with IRC networks that
conforms to the RFC 2812 (IRC Protocol).
It's orignally a port of SmartIRC (written in PHP),
but it's much more now (I will backport it to PHP5 some day).
SmartIrc4net an API that handles all IRC protocol messages and is designed for
creating IRC bots or even GUI clients.
